[This](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html#cmakelists-txt) shows how to create a basic executable.

[This](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-Composition.html) shows how to create components, which can be loaded later as standalone or as a sort of *nodelet*.
