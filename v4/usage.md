# Tool Usage

HAROS is a framework composed of the main `haros` tool and a series of other tools that it depends on.
The smaller tools can be used/installed/developed independently.

## Commands

```
$ haros init
```

- creates a new haroshome dir
- sets the `HAROS_HOME` environment variable to the path of the new dir

```
$ haros config ...
```

- sets global options in the `haros.config` file for the current/default `HAROS_HOME`

```
$ haros analysis ...
```

- executes the analysis workflow (on a given project?)

## Tools and Components

- `harosmake`, the *compiler* (model extractor)
- `haroscpp`, the `roscpp` parser, interpreter and code generator
- `harospy`, the `rospy` parser, interpreter and code generator
- `haroslaunch`, the launch XML file parser and interpreter
- `haroscheck`, the plugin-driven analyser
- `harosviz`, the model and report visualizer

## Workflow

### The Complete Workflow

1. User input (and storage loading)
2. File system scanning (package and workspace finder)
3. Model extraction (parsing and interpreting files)
4. Analysis (static, given a complete model)
5. Code generation (given a complete model)
6. Testing (dynamic analysis, possibly using generated code)
7. Processing (analysis of reports from previous steps)
8. Output (storage dump)
9. Visualization

### The Model Extraction Workflow

1. User input
2. File system scanning
3. Model extraction
4. Output

### The Analysis Workflow

1. User input
2. Analysis
3. Code generation
4. Testing
5. Processing
6. Output
